def correlation_index(factors_1, factors_2, tol=5e-16, method='stacked'):
    """
    CorrIndex implementation to assess tensor decomposition outputs.
    From [1] Sobhani et al 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2022.108457).
    Metric is scaling and column-permutation invariant, wherein each column is a factor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factors_1 : dict
        Ordered dictionary containing a dataframe with the factor loadings for each
        dimension/order of the tensor. This is the result from a tensor decomposition,
        it can be found as the attribute `factors` in any tensor class derived from the
        class BaseTensor (e.g. BaseTensor.factors).

    factors_2 : dict
        Similar to factors_1 but coming from another tensor decomposition of a tensor
        with equal shape.

    tol : float, default=5e-16
        Precision threshold below which to call the CorrIndex score 0.

    method : str, default='stacked'
        Method to obtain the CorrIndex by comparing the A matrices from two decompositions.
        Possible options are:

        - 'stacked' : The original method implemented in [1]. Here all A matrices from the same decomposition are
                      vertically concatenated, building a big A matrix for each decomposition.
        - 'max_score' : This computes the CorrIndex for each pair of A matrices (i.e. between A_1 in factors_1 and
                        factors_2, between A_2 in factors_1 and factors_2, and so on). Then the max score is
                        selected (the most conservative approach). In other words, it selects the max score among the
                        CorrIndexes computed dimension-wise.
        - 'min_score' : Similar to 'max_score', but the min score is selected (the least conservative approach).
        - 'avg_score' : Similar to 'max_score', but the avg score is selected.

    Returns
    -------
    score : float
         CorrIndex metric [0,1]; lower score indicates higher similarity between matrices
