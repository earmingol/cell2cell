In ecology, the euclidean distance preserved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is often not a good choice because it deals poorly with double zeros (Species have unimodal distributions along environmental gradients, so if a species is absent from two sites at the same site, it can't be known if an environmental variable is too high in one of them and too low in the other, or too low in both, etc. On the other hand, if an species is present in two sites, that means that the sites are similar.).

It can be: - 'expression_thresholding' - 'expression_product' - 'expression_mean' - 'expression_gmean' - 'cci_score' : is the scoring function to aggregate the communication scores. It can be: - 'bray_curtis' - 'jaccard' - 'count' - 'cci_type' : is the type of interaction between two cells. If it is undirected, all ligands and receptors are considered from both cells. If it is directed, ligands from one cell and receptors from the other are considered separately with respect to ligands from the second cell and receptor from the first one. So, it can be: - 'undirected' - 'directed cutoff_setup : dict Contains two keys: 'type' and 'parameter'. The first key represent the way to use a cutoff or threshold, while parameter is the value used to binarize the expression values. The key 'type' can be: - 'local_percentile' : computes the value of a given percentile, for each gene independently. In this case, the parameter corresponds to the percentile to compute, as a float value between 0 and 1. - 'global_percentile' : computes the value of a given percentile from all genes and samples simultaneously. In this case, the parameter corresponds to the percentile to compute, as a float value between 0 and 1. All genes have the same cutoff. - 'file' : load a cutoff table from a file. Parameter in this case is the path of that file. It must contain the same genes as index and same samples as columns. - 'multi_col_matrix' : a dataframe must be provided, containing a cutoff for each gene in each sample. This allows to use specific cutoffs for each sample. The columns here must be the same as the ones in the rnaseq_data. - 'single_col_matrix' : a dataframe must be provided, containing a cutoff for each gene in only one column. These cutoffs will be applied to all samples. - 'constant_value' : binarizes the expression. Evaluates whether expression is greater than the value input in the parameter. interaction_space : cell2cell.core.interaction_space.InteractionSpace Interaction space that contains all the required elements to perform the cell-cell interaction and communication analysis between every pair of cells. After performing the analyses, the results are stored in this object. aggregation_method : str Specifies the method to use to aggregate gene expression of single cells into their respective cell types. Used to perform the CCI analysis since it is on the cell types rather than single cells. Options are: - 'nn_cell_fraction' : Among the single cells composing a cell type, it calculates the fraction of single cells with non-zero count values of a given gene. - 'average' : Computes the average gene expression among the single cells composing a cell type for a given gene. ccc_permutation_pvalues : pandas.DataFrame Contains the P-values of the permutation analysis on the communication scores. cci_permutation_pvalues : pandas.DataFrame Contains the P-values of the permutation analysis on the CCI scores. __adata : boolean Auxiliary variable used for storing whether rnaseq_data is an AnnData object.

It can be: - 'bray_curtis' - 'jaccard' - 'count' - 'cci_type' : is the type of interaction between two cells. If it is undirected, all ligands and receptors are considered from both cells. If it is directed, ligands from one cell and receptors from the other are considered separately with respect to ligands from the second cell and receptor from the first one. So, it can be: - 'undirected' - 'directed cutoff_setup : dict Contains two keys: 'type' and 'parameter'. The first key represent the way to use a cutoff or threshold, while parameter is the value used to binarize the expression values. The key 'type' can be: - 'local_percentile' : computes the value of a given percentile, for each gene independently. In this case, the parameter corresponds to the percentile to compute, as a float value between 0 and 1. - 'global_percentile' : computes the value of a given percentile from all genes and samples simultaneously. In this case, the parameter corresponds to the percentile to compute, as a float value between 0 and 1. All genes have the same cutoff. - 'file' : load a cutoff table from a file. Parameter in this case is the path of that file. It must contain the same genes as index and same samples as columns. - 'multi_col_matrix' : a dataframe must be provided, containing a cutoff for each gene in each sample. This allows to use specific cutoffs for each sample. The columns here must be the same as the ones in the rnaseq_data. - 'single_col_matrix' : a dataframe must be provided, containing a cutoff for each gene in only one column. These cutoffs will be applied to all samples. - 'constant_value' : binarizes the expression. Evaluates whether expression is greater than the value input in the parameter. permutations : int, default=100 Number of permutations where in each of them a random shuffle of labels is performed, followed of computing CCI scores to create a null distribution. permuted_label : str, default='gene_labels' Label to be permuted. Types are: - 'genes' : Permutes cell-labels in a gene-specific way. - 'gene_labels' : Permutes the labels of genes in the RNA-seq dataset. - 'cell_labels' : Permutes the labels of cell-types/tissues/samples in the RNA-seq dataset. excluded_cells : list, default=None List of cells to exclude from the analysis. consider_size : boolean, default=True Whether considering the size of the distribution for limiting small probabilities to be as minimal as the reciprocal of the size. verbose : boolean, default=False Whether printing or not steps of the analysis. Returns ------- cci_pvals : pandas.DataFrame Matrix where rows and columns are cell-types/tissues/samples and each value is a P-value for the corresponding CCI score.

This list matches the length of interactions and the labels have to follows the same order. how : str, default='inner' Approach to consider cell types and genes present across multiple contexts. - 'inner' : Considers only cell types and genes that are present in all contexts (intersection). - 'outer' : Considers all cell types and genes present across contexts (union). communication_score : str, default='expression_mean' Type of communication score to infer the potential use of a given ligand- receptor pair by a pair of cells/tissues/samples. Available communication_scores are: - 'expression_mean' : Computes the average between the expression of a ligand from a sender cell and the expression of a receptor on a receiver cell. - 'expression_product' : Computes the product between the expression of a ligand from a sender cell and the expression of a receptor on a receiver cell. - 'expression_gmean' : Computes the geometric mean between the expression of a ligand from a sender cell and the expression of a receptor on a receiver cell. upper_letter_comparison : boolean, default=True Whether making uppercase the gene names in the expression matrices and the protein names in the ppi_data to match their names and integrate their respective expression level. Useful when there are inconsistencies in the names between the expression matrix and the ligand-receptor annotations.

on a single-cell dataset. In this case, we use samples from patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders, previously published on https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav8130 . Specifically, we explore how cell-cell communication is shaped by the ASD condition in the prefrontal brain cortex of patients. Read this if you plan using a GPU to speed-up the analysis.

A basic context-wise preprocessing is performed here, keeping only genes that are expressed at least in 4 single cells. The final list includes the aggregated gene expression of all context, following the same order as the previous dictionary (context_dict). The aggregation here corresponds to the fraction of single cells for a given cell type that have non-zero expression levels. Other aggregation methods could be used, as for example the average expression across single cells in a cell type. Additionally, other gene expression values could be passed, using other preprocessing approaches such as log(x+1) or batch correction methods.

Tensor-cell2cell for each element in their respective dimensions of the 4D-communication tensor (contexts, ligand-receptor pairs, sender cells, receiver cells).

the ligand-receptor pairs obtained from the tensor factorization.
