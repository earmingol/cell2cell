# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.6.1

## New features
- Implemented the option to filter for cells/genes/lr pairs that are present in a given
fraction of samples/contexts in addition to using the union or intersection to build a 
tensor derived from `BaseTensor`. This can be controlled with the parameter `outer_fraction`
in the classes/functions available in `cell2cell.tensor.tensor` and `cell2cell.tensor.external_scores`. 

## Feature updates
- `cellcell2.stats.permutation.compute_pvalue_from_dist()` ignores NaN values.
 
## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed bug of `cell2cell.tensor.concatenate_interaction_tensors()` that did not allow
concatenating tensors when using a tensorly backend different to numpy.
- Fixed bug to deal with GPU tensors in `cell2cell.tensor.tensor.PreBuiltTensor`
- Fixed bug about dimension labelling in `cell2cell.tensor.tensor.PreBuiltTensor`
