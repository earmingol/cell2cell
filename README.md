# Inferring cell-cell interactions from transcriptomes with cell2cell

## Installation
Create a new conda environment:
```
conda create -n cell2cell -y python=3.7 jupyter
```

Activate that environment:

```
conda activate cell2cell
```

Then, install cell2cell:
```
pip install cell2cell
```

## Examples
